I am deciding to release my SWBF2 hack that I spent about 15 minutes on. I dropped 100+ kill games for around a month with no ban(s) so far.

COMPILE DRIVER AND MENU WITH VISUAL STUDIO - x64 RELEASE

1) Load driver via Physmeme or any other manual mapper (Physmeme is included)
2) Open menu when game is loaded
3) Profit! 

My driver I wrote has only been tested on Window 1903, so BSODs may occur if you're on a newer version. It utilizes a simple function hook pointer (kind of overkill for this anticheat) and a menu that utilized RPM / WPM. 

If you're concerned about the driver aspect and wish for an external version, I'll post that as well. 

Includes:
[x] 20x Damage Multiplier, ESP, No Spread, No Recoil

TO DO:
[x] Add screenshot protection
